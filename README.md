# mytestproject
Hello Tatvasoft its my test.


# First we have to create a database named as 'test' and import the file test.sql in it.
	Through this out database is created.

# Now, we are making connection in 'connection.php' file, you can change the hostname, username, password fpr your connectivity.

# If connection was not proper it will show you warning at the time of excecution, you can ignor it and can test the senerio, but for inserting data in database it will require connection. 

# after setup of code only you have to directly run my repository 'manishTest' on your host.


# Please also find the versioin of PHP is 8.0.3 i am using and snap of mysql version.


Thankyou !
